\subsection{Clinical Overview}
\par{ \noindent Hypoglycaemia (also known as a “hypoglycaemic episode” or a “hypo” for short) is the condition that occurs when the human body’s blood glucose (sugar) level drops below the normal healthy range of 4.0 to 6.0 mmol/L. While it can affect anyone, it is most common in diabetic individuals who are prescribed drugs like insulin or metformin to inhibit glucose. Hypoglycaemic events are relatively simple and straightforward to resolve, but they need to be treated immediately to avoid serious damage to the brain and heart as a result of loss of consciousness or arrhythmias. High-sugar consumables are generally effective in correcting mild cases and are commonly recommended for immediate treatment, but severe cases of hypoglycaemia such as when the person is unconscious or having a seizure can only be resolved with an urgent, immediate glucagon injection to prevent them from deteriorating into a coma (or in rare cases, even leading to death). }

\par{\noindent To underscore how and why this matters, diabetes is one of the most significant and expensive long-term health conditions faced by the NHS, with recent figures from Diabetes UK suggesting that over 5.8 million people in the UK are living with diabetes, regardless of a formal diagnosis. It is estimated to cost the NHS over £10.7 billion a year, approximately 10\% of its entire annual budget, which could go up to £18 billion by 2035 [1]. A stark finding is that almost 60\% of this cost (around £6.2 billion) is spent on treating the largely preventable complications of diabetes, such as heart attacks, strokes, blindness, and so on, including hypoglycaemia [2]. Hypoglycaemic instances make up a major component of these preventable costs, mainly accounting for the emergency, ambulance, and acute care expenses associated with diabetes. The Local Impact of Hypoglycaemia Tool (LIHT) suggests that hypoglycaemia can cost up to £2,195 per episode, possibly increasing substantially with a longer stay in hospital [3], and it is estimated that there are up to 100,000 ambulance callouts annually according to the Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation (DRWF) [4]. DRWF’s study hinted that 1 in 10 individuals that experience a severe hypo (meaning requiring medical intervention or resuscitation) have considerable chances of another one within a fortnight.}

\subsection{Background} 
\par{\noindent After introspective analysis supported by information from the National Diabetes Inpatient Safety Audit (NDISA) [5] it has been recognized that severe hypoglycaemia and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia have been occurring relatively frequently across GSTT medical facilities. The NDISA forms part of the National Diabetes Audit (NDA), and it maintains that “The prevalence of diabetes continues to increase. In England between 2017-18 and 2021-22 prevalence of type 1 diabetes went up from 248,240 to 270,935 and the prevalence of type 2 and other diabetes from 2,952,695 to 3,336,980”, as of 2022 [5]. }

\par{\noindent GSTT administers upwards of 500,000 point-of-care glucose tests (POCT) annually, in addition to kidney function and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) tests as well. The Trust also possesses blood glucose / ketone data with additional linked data including demographics, dates of admission and discharge, patient as well as family history and current or previous medications. They have two major kinds of patient records, inpatient records for patients that have to stay over the course of one or multiple nights (for example, in case of surgeries or for long term care), and outpatient records where the patient doesn’t require overnight stay. The Trust manages all of this data through their electronic health record management system called Epic, and facilitates patient access to their own records through the MyChart web application.}

\vspace{10pt}
\par{\noindent Hypoglycaemia is a frequent complication amongst inpatients having complex health conditions, especially within those in intensive care settings that have been / are critically ill due to advanced diseases or comorbidities, or in patients following major surgical interventions. The Trust is undertaking proactive measures to identify and mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes at an early stage, to support better planning, reduce healthcare costs, efficiently allocate hospital resources and also schedule operations optimally. The ideal way to assess risk would along the lines of developing tools to predict individualized risk scores for inpatients after considering all relevant factors. However, this presents a herculean task due to the sheer volume and complexity of factors involved, compounded by the challenges of producing reliable results even within small populations — such as those in remote areas — while also adhering to legal and governmental regulations: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Weighing up the risk of hypoglycaemia depends upon numerous aspects such as lifestyle, renal function, recent food intake, blood glucose history and current medication to name a few, making this a highly complicated modelling problem. In addition to this, patients differ widely in age, comorbidities, ethnic factors and even insulin sensitivity. This variability makes it a formidable challenge to develop a model that is generalizable, dependable and unbiased.
	\item Any such analytical tool in the vicinity of patient healthcare requires medical evaluation and approval, validation trials, governance oversight as well as ethical considerations. Even a good model may fail if it does not fit the clinical workflow. Initial skepticism towards AI, the effort required to train staff, defining clear responsibilities and limits of liability, and rehearsing procedures or plans of action for every possible scenario will all produce appreciable organizational inertia.
\end{enumerate}
}

\vspace{10pt}
\par{\noindent Successfully implementing even a small-scale solution, within GSTT to begin with, would be a significant strategic breakthrough that serves as a foundational model which other NHS trusts or institutions could adapt and build upon. This positions this initiative as a valuable, worthwhile research endeavour.}
