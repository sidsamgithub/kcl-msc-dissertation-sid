    \textbf{Variant 4 - Develop a weighted score and design score to predict episode of hypoglycaemia before it occurs.} \\

    \par This research project serves as a foundation and proof-of-concept to aid GSTT in pre-emptively reducing hypoglycemia and its episodes within hospitalised patients, by utilising statistics \& machine learning techniques. I go on to identify the significant factors responsible for hypoglycemia, and explore how they can be utilized to create a risk score, to classify patients with severe or recurrent severe hypoglycemia, and in conclusion, exhibit my findings with potential ways of applying them in practise in hospitals.
